It's **Md. Fahim Bin Amin**, author [@freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/fahimbinamin/), open-source contributor. I am also a contributor to [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) Research Investigation to OSS. Currently, I am working actively on the official [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Bengali team as a volunteer {üéâ I am the 3rd Bangladeshi and the first and the only student from my university, [United International University](https://www.uiu.ac.bd/), who got this opportunity to work with the official team of freeCodeCamp üòã}.

Basically, I like to work with Python, Java, C, C++, Markdown and so on. You can check my **blog site** [here](https://blog.fahimbinamin.com/).

I like to teach others about programming and technical stuff. I have [a Brand YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FahimAmin) where I teach programming and technical stuff regularly.

I also write articles frequently on various well-known platforms. Among those, [freeCodeCamp English](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/fahimbinamin/), [freeCodeCamp Bengali](https://www.freecodecamp.org/bengali/news/author/fahimbinamin/), [Dev.to](https://dev.to/fahimfba) and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@FahimFBA) are my most favourite platforms. üòä
