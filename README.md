# Hello, everyone! <img src="./img/wave.gif" width="35px">

It's **Md. Fahim Bin Amin**, author [@freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/fahimbinamin/), open-source contributor. I am also a contributor to [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) Research Investigation to OSS. Currently I am working actively on the official [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Bengali team as a volunteer {ðŸŽ‰ I am the 3rd Bangladeshi and the first and the only student from my university, [United International University](https://www.uiu.ac.bd/), who got this opportunity to work with the official team of freeCodeCamp ðŸ˜‹}. I am also working at [draft.dev](https://draft.dev/) as a technical content writer.

Basically I like to work with Python, Java, C, C++, Markdown and so on. My preferable operarting system is Linux and Windows. 
*âš¡Fun fact: I have experimented with more than 67 Linux distros till now. ðŸ˜Ž My favorite Linux OS is [Vanilla Arch](https://archlinux.org/) and [ArcoLinux](https://arcolinux.com/).* 

I forgot to mention that I also love Windows 11 so much. ðŸ˜Š

I also like to teach others about programming and technical stuff. I have two YouTube Brand channels. [In one channel, I publish English content](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG97GCUifMS2Vm28tgXQi0Q); [in the other channel, I publish Bengali content](https://www.youtube.com/c/InnovationWithIphim).

I also write articles frequently in various well-known platforms. Among those, [freeCodeCamp English](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/fahimbinamin/), [freeCodeCamp Bengali](https://www.freecodecamp.org/bengali/news/author/fahimbinamin/), [Dev.to](https://dev.to/fahimfba) and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@FahimFBA) are my most favourite platforms. ðŸ˜Š
